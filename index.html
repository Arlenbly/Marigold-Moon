        <p>Hello and welcome to Marigold Moon Healing, my name is Micaela Pacheco. I am a channel, a curandera and a
            reiki practitioner. </p>
        <p>As a small child, I was deeply curious in the divine and other worldly. I have so many fond memories of
            playing freely as a sorceress with a collection of wonders. As I grew up, the pressure of society and
            colonization quieted my intuition and curiosity. I began to feel the need to conform; to try and put myself
            into a cage that I could never fit in. </p>
        <p>Experiencing the world as a sensitive being felt like my biggest weakness, but I now know it is my greatest
            strength. </p>
        <p>Even through the trials of living in a colonized world, I caught glimpses of the divine. At the most
            challenging time in my life, when feeling was too much so I no longer wanted to feel at all, my journey with
            curanderismo began.
        </p>
        <p>My sister invited me to a natural health fair. At the fair, there were several curanderas giving healing
            sessions. At the time I knew very little about spirituality and curanderas, but I was open to it. I walked
            up to the curandera and she began the session. I closed my eyes and I was shortly transported to a deep
            mediative state; I felt as though I was floating. It was a much different sensation or feeling than I had
            ever had in my life. Thats when I knew there was more to the world than what meets the eye. The woman before
            me was deeply intuitive and somehow knew all that I had been struggling with. This experience forever
            changed my life and opened me up to my connection with what I refer to as spirit or the divine, that which
            exists in all living things.</p>
        <p>Years later, I was grappling with my soul purpose and decided to sign up for a course, Called to Heal. This
            decision pushed me into my next spiritual awakening. I learned my great great grandmother was a curandera. I
            discovered she was with me, supporting me, and guiding me. Ever since, I have been connecting more and more
            deeply to my ancestors and the indigenous practices that live within me. I was awakened to the path toward
            my soul purpose, to a knowing that would bring me a profound sense of trust in myself and the love and light
            within me. </p>
        <p>Through a network of healing connections, I was lead to Yessi; a fourth generation curandera of Lady Lotus
            healing. As I moved through this training, it felt as though I was being reminded of things that already
            lived within me; of the knowledge and wisdom that I had acquired through my many lifetimes. Yessi and her
            mom, Lilly, provided a safe and judgement free space that allowed me to recognize the beauty and power
            within indigenous healing practices and the world of the divine. I look forward to providing a space that
            continues to uphold these qualities. Stepping into my power was one of the most amazing things I have done
            and something I hope to assist others in. We are all very powerful beings who deserve to know and understand
            our power. I am so deeply grateful and honored to walk this journey and to share it with you.
