                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p>Hello and welcome to Marigold Moon Healing. My name is Micaela Pacheco. I am a channel, a
                                curandera, and a reiki practitioner.</p>
                            <p>I was interested in magic and magical practices as a kid, from playing sorcerers to
                                creating the most magical worlds. I was drawn to crystals and other metaphysical tools.
                                As I grew up, the pressure of society quieted my intuition and curiosity. I began to
                                feel the need to conform, to try to put myself into a box I could never fit in.</p>
                            <p>Experiencing the world as a sensitive being felt like my biggest weakness, but I now know
                                it is my greatest strength.</p>
                            <p>Despite the trials of living in a colonized capitalistic society, I felt moments of
                                connection with my higher self. At the most challenging time in my life, when feelings
                                themselves felt like too much, I was looking for guidance. I was unsure where to go, and
                                that's when my eyes were opened to curanderismo.</p>
                            <p>My sister invited me to a natural health fair. At the fair, there were several curanderas
                                giving healing sessions. I knew very little about spirituality and curanderas at the
                                time, but I was open to it. I walked up to the curandera, and she began the session. I
                                closed my eyes and was shortly transported to a deep mediative state; I felt like I was
                                floating. It was a much different sensation or feeling than I had ever had. That's when
                                I knew there was more to the world than what meets the eye. The woman before me was
                                profoundly intuitive and somehow knew everything I had been struggling with. This
                                experience forever changed me and opened up my connection to the life force that exists
                                in and around all things.</p>
                            <p>Years later, I grappled with my soul's purpose and decided to sign up for a course called
                                Called to Heal. This decision pushed me into my next spiritual awakening. I learned my
                                great-great-grandmother was a curandera. I discovered she was with me, supporting me and
                                guiding me. Ever since I have been connecting more and more deeply to my ancestors and
                                the indigenous practices that live within me. I was awakened to the path toward my
                                soul's purpose, to a knowing that would bring me a profound sense of trust in myself and
                                the love and light within me.</p>
                            <p>Through a network of healing connections, I was led to train with Yessi, a
                                fourth-generation curandera of Lady Lotus Healing. Yessi and her mother, Lilly, provided
                                a safe and judgment-free space that allowed me to recognize the beauty and power within
                                indigenous healing practices and the world of the divine. As I moved through this
                                training, I was reminded of things that already lived within me. I was reminded of the
                                knowledge and wisdom I had acquired through my many lifetimes.
                                I look forward to providing a space that continues to uphold these qualities.
                            </p>
                            <p>We are all powerful beings who deserve to know and understand our power. Stepping into my
                                power was one of the most amazing things I have done and something I hope to assist
                                others in. I am incredibly grateful and honored to walk this journey and to share it
                                with you.
                            </p>
